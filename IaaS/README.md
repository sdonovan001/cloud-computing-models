With IaaS you are responsible for everything above the virtualization layer.  You can think of it as "Virtualization-as-a-Service".  This is the most flexible of the three models since you control everything above the virtualization layer.  Your staff is not only responsible for designing, building and supporting the application but you are also responsible for *right sizing* the VMs, deploying the OS, patching the OS, securing the OS... esentially you have all of the same responsibilities you have with on On-site / On-prem solution with the exception of the procurment / deployment / support of the physical assets.
