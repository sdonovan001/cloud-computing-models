# SaaS
---
Unlike the other cloud computing models, with SaaS the entire application stack is supported and managed by the provider.  There is nothing to install, update or monitor.  This model is the least flexible of the three models since you have zero control over the application code or the infrastructure it runs on.  Your only responsibility is to provide feedback to the provider in the form of bug reports and feature requests.  With SaaS your employees can focus on ensuring they are getting the most out of the application since they have no support / maintenance responsibilities. While there is often *sticker shock* associated with the cost of SaaS solutions, when you consider that you did not have to build it, are not paying for hardware and don't have to support it, they are typically the least expensive model in the long run.
