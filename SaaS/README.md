# Software as a Service

## Overview
With SaaS the entire application stack is supported and managed by the provider, unlike the other cloud computing models.  There is nothing to install, update or monitor.  This model is the least flexible of the three models since you have zero control over the application code or the infrastructure it runs on.  Your only responsibility is to provide feedback to the provider in the form of bug reports and feature requests.  With SaaS your employees can focus on ensuring they are getting the most out of using the application since they have no support / maintenance responsibilities. 

While there is sometimes *sticker shock* associated with the cost of SaaS solutions, when you consider that you do not have to build the application, are not paying for hardware and don't have to support anything, SaaS solutions are typically the least expensive of the three cloud computing models in the long run.
